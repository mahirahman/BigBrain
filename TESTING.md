6. Delete the 2rd question
7. Edit 1st question and try and remove all answers so that there is only 1 answer â€” Windows.alert should pop up. make an assertion to capture error.
8. Edit 1st question change point to 11000 Windows.alert should pop up. make an assertion to capture error.

The rationale behind this test is to show that ediiting and modifying a question is done successfully while dynamic renders.
It also shows that a user can modify any field without changing all fields. If a user only wants to change a question image they can do so and it will not affect any other question data. This has been done through multiple layers of validation of the data.

Also, there is multiple error checking when editing a question. For example trying to paste a non youtube URL to the URL embed will result in an error.
Trying to add multiple answers to a single choice question, adding single answer to multiple choice etc.

This test shows that editing a question in any sort of combination of inputs will not cause issues.
